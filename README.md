#How to create a `.file` or `.folder` on Windows

There are several ways

## 1. Rename

* Create `file.txt`
* Rename to `.file.`, the last dot will be dropped, you'll have `.file`

Works the same with a file or a directory.

## 2. Command line

File : `echo > .name`  
Directory :  `mkdir .foldername`

## 3. With Notepad

* Create a new text document and edit with Notepad
* When saving, enter `.file` as a name and select **All files (\*.*)** as file type
